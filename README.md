# Space-Shooter-AR (Android, ARCore)
Converted the entire Space Shooter game to be playable in AR. Switched all transforms and movements to local space, switched all the colliders to 3D, and scaled objects accordingly.
Download all three parts and extract with WinRAR or 7-Zip. Install the Apk and open the game.
After selecting New Game from the Main Menu, wait for the AR Core to detect a plane, when it does a placement indicator will be displayed in the center of the screen. Tap once on the screen to place the game world in the real world. Use the joystick to move and fire button to fire lasers.
